### **INTRODUCTION**
Rice production is highly sensitive to climatic conditions, particularly temperature and precipitation. Understanding how long-term climate variability affects rice yield is essential for sustainable agricultural planning and food security. This study analyzes 30 years of climate and rice yield data to evaluate trends, relationships, and variability using data analytics tools.

---
#### **OBJECTIVES**
1. Examine long-term trends in rice yield, temperature, and precipitation
2. Determine the relationship between rice yield and climatic variables
3. Identify periods of high and low productivity
4. Quantify climate variability and its potential influence on yield
5. Visualize climate-yield interactions using Python and Power BI

---
##### **KEY FINDINGS**
- Rice yield is **more sensitive to precipitation than temperature**
- Climate variability explains significant yield fluctuations
- Stable temperature with unstable rainfall creates production risk
- Long-term yield trend shows gradual improvement with fluctuations

---
###### **OBSERVATIONS**
- High rainfall years do not always guarantee high yield, indicating other agronomic factors
- Low rainfall years frequently correspond with yield decline
- Climate adaptation strategies are necessary for yield stability

---
###### **CONCLUSION**
This analysis demonstrates that while temperature remains relatively stable over the study period, precipitation variability plays a crucial role in influencing rice yield. Effective water management, irrigation planning, and climate-smart agricultural practices are essential to mitigate yield risks under changing climatic conditions.
